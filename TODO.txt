Pentagon
* "inside shape" theme
* readyPage() or appropriate calculates sequence value for pages from prev/next rels
** track currentSequence to go with sequence numbers
** something to handle up/child navigation links anyways
* tuning setting on theme for # to prefetch
* think about modularizing:
** requestPage
*** allows packing multipages in one file, no XHR needed
*** needs processPage to take separate head/body arguments
** load/apply theme
