Pentagon
* prevOff/nextOff CSS classes
** or "off" class in common...
** invert: only three onscreen have .current
*** all left ones have.prev
*** all right ones have .next
* readyPage() wraps content divs in something that lets us show title
** readyPage() or appropriate calculates sequence value for pages from prev/next rels
* 3D CSS transform
* maybe smoother CSS classes?
** .current = focused
** .show = onscreen at all
** .next = sequence # > current
* track currentSequence to go with sequence numbers
